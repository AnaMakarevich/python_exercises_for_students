"""
Write a Python function named count_occurrences(lst, element).
This function should take a list `lst` and an element `element`
as input and return the count of occurrences of that element
in the list. Make sure to test your function with different lists.

Example:
    >>> count_occurrences([1,2,3,3,5,4], 3)
    2

HINT: Search for built-in methods of lists!
BONUS: Implement the same with a loop
