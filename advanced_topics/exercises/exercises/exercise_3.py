"""
Write a function count_keywords that takes a variable number of strings (*args) and counts the occurrences of each
unique word across ALL input strings except for the excluded words. Use **kwargs to exclude specific words
from the count. The count should be case-insensitive.
You can assume that the input strings contain only words separated by spaces.
